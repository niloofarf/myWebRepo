            1. The French adverb has two parts: ne, which precedes the verb, and pas (or another word or phrase, see
            below), which follows it. When the verb is inverted, pas follows the subject pronoun.

            2. In English negation, the helping verb "do" must be added to most verbs (learn more). This is not the case
            in French: if there’s one verb in the affirmative, there’s just one verb in the negative. Likewise, if there
            are two verbs in the affirmative, as in compound tenses/moods and dual-verb constructions, there are two in
            the negative.

            When there are two verbs, ne and pas (or another word/phrase) go around the first (conjugated) verb,
            followed by the past participle or infinitive.
